In the city of Netropolis, there are two business districts, each with four office buildings. The office buildings in each district are interconnected through a local network, forming a subnet. There is also a central data center that provides internet access, essential services, and security features like firewalls to all the office buildings. The data center is connected to each office building through dedicated network lines. 

The city council of Netropolis wants to divide the city into two zones to optimize the network infrastructure and enhance security. They want to minimize the cost of transferring data between the zones while ensuring that the firewalls and other security measures are effectively protecting the network. 

Here's the updated story with the costs and security aspects: 
- The cost of transferring data between office buildings within the same subnet (business district) is 1 unit.
- The cost of transferring data between office buildings in different subnets (business districts) is 2 units.
- The cost of transferring data between the central data center and each office building, including the firewall and other security measures, is 3 units. 

The city council wants to find the best way to divide the city into two zones to minimize the total cost of transferring data between the zones and maintain a high level of security. 

To solve this problem, the city council uses a quantum computer running the SamplingVQE algorithm. The algorithm finds the optimal division of the city into two zones, minimizing the total cost of transferring data between the zones while ensuring that the firewalls and other security measures are effectively protecting the network.
